# ReflectiveBlog

TODO: turn this repo into GitHub Pages where I update it everyweek with a post reflecting on work and learning I have done.
maybe in Flask?

TODO: add good questions to ask at the end of each week
Example qustions:
Experiences gone and still to come:
What you have learned (or are struggling to learn):
Specific characteristics you have shown or need to develop:
How it relates to what you already know:
How it relates to your more specific goals:
How it relates to your strengths and weaknesses:
How do you feel about each of your reflections? Do you think you are: Growing your understanding of yourself? Changing your thoughts and mindset? Changing in your perception of who you are?
